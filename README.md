# CloudBot

CloudBot is a simple, fast, expandable open-source Python IRC Bot!

## Getting CloudBot

This is my fork of cloudbot. For the official version, see [This github project](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/).

## Installing CloudBot

Firstly, CloudBot will only run on **Python 3.4 or higher**. Because we use the asyncio module, you will not be able to use any other versions of Python.

To install CloudBot on *nix (linux, etc), see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-*nix)

To install CloudBot on Windows, see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-Windows)


### Running CloudBot

Before you run the bot, rename `config.default.json` to `config.json` and edit it with your preferred settings. You can check if your JSON is valid using [jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com/).

Once you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:

```
python3.4 -m cloudbot
```

Note that you can also run the `cloudbot/__main__.py` file directly, which will work from any directory.
```
python3.4 CloudBot/cloudbot/__main__.py
```
Specify the path as /path/to/repository/cloudbot/__main__.py, where `cloudbot` is inside the repository directory.
