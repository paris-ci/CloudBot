# How to contribute

Thanks for taking interest in making this fork of cloudbot the best. Even if you don't know how to code you can still contrubute by opening a issue and suggesting a new feature or by reporting bugs.

The following guidelines for contribution should be followed if you want to submit a pull request. If you have any troubles, just come and ask us for help on our IRC channel or create a issue on github.

## Basic Overview

* Read [Github documentation](http://help.github.com/) and [Pull Request documentation](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/)
* Fork the repository
* Edit the files, add new files
* Check that the files work as expected in CloudBot
* Create a new branch with a descriptive name for your feature (optional)
* Commit changes, push to your fork on GitHub
* Create a new pull request, provide a short summary of changes in the title line, with more information in the description field.
* After submitting the pull request, join the IRC channel (irc.esper.net #cloudbot) and give us a link so we know you submitted it.
* After discussion, your pull request will be accepted or rejected.

## How to prepare

* You need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit an [issue ticket](https://github.com/ClouDev/CloudBot/issues) for your issue if there is no one yet.
  * Try to describe the issue and include steps to reproduce if it's a bug.
* If you are able and want to fix this, fork the repository on GitHub

## Make Changes

* In your forked repository, create a topic branch for your upcoming patch. (optional) 
* Make sure you stick to the coding style that is used already.
* Make use of the [`.editorconfig`](http://editorconfig.org/) file.
* Make commits that make sense and describe them properly.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Check your changes with [`pep8`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8). You can usually ignore messages about line length, but we like to keep lines shorter then 120 characters if at all possible.

## Submit Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Open a pull request to the original repository and choose the `master` branch.
	_Advanced users may use [`hub`](https://github.com/defunkt/hub#git-pull-request) gem for that._
* If not done in commit messages (which you really should do) please reference and update your issue with the code changes. But _please do not close the issue yourself_.
_Notice: You can [turn your previously filed issues into a pull-request here](http://issue2pr.herokuapp.com/)._
